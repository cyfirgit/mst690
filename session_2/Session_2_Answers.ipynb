It's hard to say with certainty about the tweets that are short replies to others, since the context lies entirely with the original tweet, but the generated tweets that have any real \"meat\" to them are only semi-coherent.  It looks like it gets all the buzzwords, but it doesn't know what they mean in relation to each other.  In some cases, it mashes together multiple themes mid-tweet.  Most hilariously, it seems to be streaming mulitple retweets together into a single tweet if it can fit more than one into the character limit.<br>\n",
